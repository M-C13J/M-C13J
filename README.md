## Hi there 👋

👨‍🎓 I am currently a MSc CyberSecurity Student at Surrey, who has a keen passion in creating secure software.
🎮 Also, I am a very keen game developer, having developed ROBLOX games in the past.
🗺️ Oh yeah, and sometimes I like to make websites.
✨ One day, I aspire to be a Security consultant at a top firm.
